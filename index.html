                                    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                                    <p>From a young age I had a strong inclination towards puzzles and gaming, I was 4 years old when I started learning chess after I got transfixed with a computer game called Fritz and Chesster whilst playing on a mac in the local apple store, I begged my mum to buy me the game and luckily she did and my journey into gaming began.</p>
                                    <p>As I grew older I started to come proficient in problem solving, I learn't how to solve sudoku's and started building my collection of rubik's cubes (Which is still growing ever larger even today)</p>
                                    <p>Also my love of sports started young with me dragging my parents to my sunday league football games just to watch us lose most likely, I wouldn't say I was ever very good at football but I loved being a part of a team and working towards a common goal.</p>
                                    <p>Nowadays I don't particularly play many sports except on occasion for fun but I have got a new found love in running, having started in November of last year, just a month later in December I finished my first half marathon, admittidely with a rather unimpressive time of 2 hours 11 minutes, but now I am looking forward to improving my time later on in the year of 2024</p>
                                    <p>Video Games have been ever present in my life, I always remember the day my dad brought home our playstation 3 or when the nintendo wii was released and my whole family was making there Mii's so we could play wii sports together. This led to me saving up for my first desktop computer and playing games like Diablo 3 and World of Warcraft throughout my teenage years whilst also giving me my first glimpses into learning how to program with Visual Basic for my GCSE Computer Science assignment.</p>
                                    <p>Also part of my daily routine is reading fiction, I mainly read Sci-Fi, Fantasy and Manga however I do like to add in some classics when I am in between series, some of my personal favourite books and series include the Red Rising series by Pierce Brown, the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov, The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde, Brave New World by Aldous Huxley and 1984 by George Orwell</p>
                                    <p>Another side passion of mine is playing micro stakes poker, after playing with play money for years slowly learning how to play no limit texas hold'em I decided to finally invest into myself with £30 of credit which im proud to announce has made me a £6 profit! If I had a day job id tell myself not to quit it!</p>

                                <div class="accordion-text" id = "university">
                                    <h1>Education</h1>
                                    <p>In September of 2019 I started my Computer Science for Games course at the university of Brighton, my first two years at university </p>
                                    <p>My dissertation project centered on coding an Inventory System tailored for Modern RPGs, I utilized Unity and C# to develop a seamless interface for players to efficiently manage in-game resources and items. I chose this as my dissertation project as I very much enjoyed creating User Interfaces whether that be in websites or games and I think this could be a topic that I end up specializing in later on in my career.</p>
                                    <p>In parallel, for my game engine development module, I used C++ to create an achievement system for video games along with the creation of an engaging game demo to demonstrate the utility of the system I had made.</p>
                                    <p>The only real JavaScript experience I had before applying for FAC came in the form of me making a game using the Phaser Game Engine for my web-based game development module, this however didn't really help me with my FAC application due to how much the game engine held my hand it didnt really feel like I was programming in JavaScript. Also being so used to object-oriented programming and scripting, I ended up using classes for everything in my game which probably isn't the most efficient course of action, but it did help me wrap my head around JavaScript and ultimately helped me finish the game.</p>
                                    <p>In multiplayer gaming, I engineered a dynamic rendition of Pong featuring client-server architecture and incorporating features such as power-ups and multiple entities, demonstrating adeptness in C++ and networked game development.</p>
                                    <p>Furthermore, expertise in designing and optimizing data structures is evident, with a specialized focus on enhancing performance through the efficient utilization of hashtables and sorting algorithms, facilitating rapid data retrieval and manipulation.</p>
                                    <p>• Finally after all my hard work In July of 2022 I graduated with a 1st class BSc(Hons) Degree!</p>
                                    <p>• For the Code of all my projects mentioned here GOTO the projects section of this website!</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <div class="accordion-info">
                                <div class="accordion-text" id="post-uni">
                                    <h1>Post-Uni</h1>
                                    <p>Following my graduation from University, I embarked on a freeCodeCamp course focusing on Responsive Web Design, an experience that I thoroughly enjoyed and which ultimately led me to create my own portfolio website. 
                                        Also, I secured my first job post University as an Assistant Installation Engineer at Absolute Digital Solutions designing and installing CCTV security systems.
                                        This position was initially intended as a short-term engagement lasting six months, however I ended up staying for 10 months following our teams good work and to be honest because I felt very comfortable in my job role. 
                                        I enjoyed my time in the industry but I knew that in the long term my career goals were aimed at becoming a software developer and so I parted ways with my first job in hope of more opportunities in the software development world.
                                        Now after numerous applications in the job market yielding no success, I feel like maybe Im not ready to go into a entry-level job in the software industry, 
                                        then I was fortunate enough to receive a recommendation for FAC and I learned about the program and discovered that it sounds like a great opportunity for where I am at in my programming and career journey.</p>

                                    <p>I was recommended to apply by Mike Nuttall, CTO at MyTutor, he told me that he had hired students from the course himself and that he felt that FAC really had the power to help me in my journey towards a meaningful career. After going to a coding meetup, socialising with other applicants and going to the online course info session Ive realised FAC is a great community and Id love to be a bigger part of it. In terms of my career I want to transition from    </p>
                                    <p>I'm genuinely drawn to the collaborative ethos embraced by Founders and Coders. The idea of being part of a community committed to mutual support and leveraging our freshly honed skills to enact tangible change greatly resonates with me.<p>
